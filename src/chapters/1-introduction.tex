\chapter{Introduction}

Created by John Gruber in 2004, with extensive help by Aaron Swartz as a tester, Markdown is a markup language that became extremely popular and widely adopted. It allows its users to format text using a syntax which focuses on readability and simplicity.\\

Drawing inspiration from previously existing markup languages that were used on email and usenet clients, such as reStructuredText and Textile, and inspired by Aaron Swartz's recently created markup language named atx, John Gruber created two things: the syntax for a language, and a simple Perl script ("Markdown.pl") which replaces the markers for that language with HTML tags.\\

This article aims to explore the Markdown standard (or lack thereof), explore why several variations of it exist, and address the issues arising from the diversity of these variations.
