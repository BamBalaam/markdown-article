\chapter{Issues surrounding Markdown}
\label{chap:issues}

\vspace{1cm}

Markdown achieved its objectives of readability and simplicity, which were the main arguments for its fast rise in popularity.
What started as a simple Perl script that converts Markdown to HTML via regex replacements became a phenomenon, and was adopted in many
famous online services and pieces of software. However, there is no real ``specification'' for Markdown beyond the original blog post
introducing the language and a few other pages on Gruber's website.\footcite{gruber2004markdown}
With time, one of Markdown's strengths, it's simplicity, also became one of its flaws for a few reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item While integrating Markdown, many developers realised that unfortunately the official Perl script is filled with unintentional
    blind spots and breaking states, which generate invalid HTML;
    \item Users feel that some necessary features are missing;
    \item Other output formats than HTML were often requested, chiefly PDF.
\end{itemize}

These issues led to various implementations and syntaxes appearing all over the web-space (see chapter \ref{chap:proliferation}),
most of them incompatible with each other.

\section{Blind spots}

Creators of alternative Markdown implementations list several blind spots and issues in the original Markdown specification in order to
justify their creations. Listed below is a non-exhaustive list of the most reoccurring ones:\newline

\textbf{The number of space characters required in order to distinguish elements of a sub-list in a list}\newline

xxx\newline

\textbf{Whether blank lines are required or not after a block quote or header}\newline

xxx\newline

\textbf{Is a space character allowed or not when creating inline links}\newline
